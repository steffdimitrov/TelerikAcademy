A namespace is a collection of element and attribute names identified by a Uniform Resource 
Identifier reference. The reference may appear in the root element as a value of the xmlns 
attribute. For example, the namespace reference for an XML document with a root element <x> 
might appear like this:
 
<x xmlns="http://www.company.com/company-schema">
	    
More than one namespace may appear in a single XML document, to allow a name to be used more than 
once. Each reference can declare a prefix to be used by each name, so the previous example might 
appear as:
 
<x xmlns:spc="http://www.company.com/company-schema">
	    
which would nominate the namespace for the ‘spc’ prefix:
 
<spc:name>Mr. Big</spc:name>
	    
The reference does not need to be a physical file; it is simply a way to distinguish between 
namespaces. The reference should tell a person looking at the XML document where to find 
definitions of the element and attribute names using that particular namespace.
