In computing, a uniform resource identifier (URI) is a string of characters used to identify a name 
of a resource. Such identification enables interaction with representations of the resource over a 
network, typically the World Wide Web, using specific protocols. Schemes specifying a concrete 
syntax and associated protocols define each URI. The most common form of URI is the uniform 
resource locator (URL), frequently referred to informally as a web address. More rarely seen in 
usage is the uniform resource name (URN), which was designed to complement URLs by providing a 
mechanism for the identification of resources in particular namespaces.
