                        In botany, a fruit is a part of a flowering plant that 
                        derives from specific tissues of the flower, one or more 
                        ovaries, and in some cases accessory tissues. Fruits are 
                        the means by which these plants disseminate seeds. Many 
                        of them that bear edible fruits, in particular, have 
                        propagated with the movements of humans and animals in a 
                        symbiotic relationship as a means for seed dispersal and 
                        nutrition, respectively; in fact, humans and many animals 
                        have become dependent on fruits as a source of food. 
                        Fruits account for a substantial fraction of the world's 
                        agricultural output, and some (such as the apple and the 
                        pomegranate) have acquired extensive cultural and symbolic 
                        meanings.
