Line 9         This document is intended to provide electronics hobbyists with some useful
Line 10        notes the author has gathered whilst working on various systems. It is not
Line 11        intended to train or encourage novices to attempt service or modifications
Line 12        to expensive appliances. It is especially not intended to encourage
Line 13        unqualified personnel to tamper with dangerous appliances such as monitors,
Line 14        power supplies and other devices which contain vacuum tubes, live mains or
Line 15        high-tension rails, or other hazardous areas. Any such work carried out is
Line 16        done at the reader's own risk and the author accepts no reponsibility for
Line 17        damage to property or person which occurs as a result of attempting any of
Line 18        the procedures described herein.
Line 19                Having said that, I can vouch for the workability of the
Line 20        modifications listed here. I have personally performed them all myself on my
Line 21        own machines (this is, after all, a chronicle of my own experiences, chopped
Line 22        up under suitable headings for your convenience). With regards to the service
Line 23        information, whilst I have described problems and the solution(s) I found,
Line 24        keep in mind that this is rather like a doctor prescribing medication over
Line 25        the telephone or from an encyclopaedia. What I mean by this statement is that
Line 26        different problems may well cause the same symptoms; to take a trivial
Line 27        example, if you turn your monitor on and nothing happens, perhaps the fuse is
Line 28        blown, but on the other hand, perhaps it is not plugged in, or perhaps there
Line 29        is a more sinister fault in the power supply section. For this reason, I
Line 30        suggest you use the service information as a very vague guide ONLY. Remember;
Line 31        it is very rare to find two machines which are exactly the same inside, and
Line 32        so what I have found to be a suitable solution to a given fault may be
Line 33        totally inappropriate to your situation.
